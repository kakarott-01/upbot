bot-engine/leverage_mixin.py
==============================
Provides leverage-aware position sizing and execution hooks
that CryptoAlgo (and any future leveraged algo) can use.

This is intentionally a mixin (not a subclass of BaseAlgo) so it can
be composed freely without breaking the existing class hierarchy.

Usage in CryptoAlgo._execute_live_trade:
    # Pull leverage from staged open
    leverage = self._staged_open.get(symbol, {}).get("leverage", 1)

    # Use this mixin's sizing helper
    qty, sl_dist_pct = self.calc_leveraged_position(balance, price, leverage)

    # Then call setup + place order
    await self.connector.setup_futures_position(symbol, leverage)
    order = await self.connector.place_order(symbol, signal, qty)
