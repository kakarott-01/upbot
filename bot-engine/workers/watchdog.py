bot-engine/workers/watchdog.py  — v3
=======================================

FIXES from v2:
  1. HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS raised from 180 → 420.
     Root cause of the infinite-restart loop: the cycle interval is 180s and
     the watchdog timeout was also 180s.  The watchdog fired at the exact same
     moment as the first cycle, before the cycle had a chance to update
     ctx.last_heartbeat, so every bot was considered dead immediately after
     its first cycle.  420s = 2.3× the cycle interval — the bot must now miss
     at least two full cycles before a restart is triggered.

  2. Double grace period for new-context bots (last_heartbeat is None).
     The existing grace `elapsed < timeout` was still the same 180s that the
     cycle fires at.  Changed to `elapsed < timeout * _NEW_BOT_GRACE_MULTIPLIER`
     (2×, so 840s) so a freshly-started bot is never restarted before it has
     had a chance to complete two cycles.

  3. Preserve original started_at on restart.
     Previously start_user_bot was called with `started_at=now`, which wrote
     the restart timestamp into bot_statuses.started_at, making the TopBar
     show "38s" while Bot History (which reads bot_sessions, written once at
     user-initiated start) showed the correct duration.
     Fix: pass `ctx.started_at` — the original start time preserved in the
     BotContext — so the DB never loses the true session origin.

Watchdog restart counters are tracked in memory per process.
